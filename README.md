# Automatic-Essay-Scoring-using-Machine-Learning
The AES project aims to develop and implement a ML model capable of analyzing and evaluating essays. AES systems use various techniques and algorithms to assess the quality and content
of essays.This system builds an Automated Essay Scoring (AES) system using Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) embeddings.GloVe embeddings with the dimensions 50d,100d or 300d can be used here. 
The traditional models (Linear regression and SVM) is created for evaluating the output.
